# The Made Tech Productionisation Checklist

The SRE team at Made Tech have created a checklist that they use to evaluate the new projects for their readiness to be productionised.

We evaluate the projects in the following areas:

- Testability
- Availability of different environments
- Database durability
- Continuous Delivery Pipeline
- Logging
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Dependency upgrade and Vulnerability alerts

In addition to these requirements, we also expect projects to use source control management, provide a mechanism to seed the local database environment and adhere to our standards (RFCS) for areas such as `Makefiles` and code editor defaults.

The full checklist can be seen here: [`PRODUCTIONISATION.md`][link_productionisation].
